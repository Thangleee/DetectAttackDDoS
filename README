## DDoS Attack Detection Using Machine Learning

## Dataset Download

Due to GitHub's file size limit, the dataset is hosted externally.

[Click here to download the dataset (Google Drive)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ElWbS-LcLredkIvwvO5aW8bPQdHRe6CQ/view?usp=sharing) (train)

This project demonstrates how to detect Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks using a machine learning model trained on network traffic data.

##Objectives

- Load and preprocess network traffic data
- Use a trained `Random Forest` model to classify DDoS and benign traffic
- Evaluate model performance using confusion matrix and classification metrics

##Installation

Create a virtual environment (optional) and install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r Requirement.txt
Usage
Place your test dataset in the datasets/ folder.

Make sure the model file datarf_model.pkl is available (adjust the path in the notebook).

Open and run Detect_attack_DDoS.ipynb step by step.

Expected columns in dataset:
Feature columns (e.g., Flow Duration, Total Fwd Packets, etc.)

A Label column with values like "DDoS" or "BENIGN"

Outputs
Classification Report (precision, recall, f1-score)

Confusion Matrix for visual performance assessment

Example
After running the notebook, you should see output like:

Edit
              precision    recall  f1-score   support

       BENIGN       0.98      0.97      0.97       500
         DDoS       0.96      0.98      0.97       480
Notes
The model assumes binary classification: DDoS (1) and Others (0)

Columns like Flow ID, Src IP, Dst IP, and Timestamp should be dropped before prediction

Future Improvements
Expand model to detect other attack types

Deploy as a real-time detection API

Include more robust preprocessing and feature selection
